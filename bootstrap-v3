For does who want to use bootstrap 3 panel as equal height in a row with css flex style
You shoud do as following example:

#which is direction is row

<div class="row flex-row">
    <div class="col-md-4 col-xs-12 flex-row">
        <div class="panel panel-default" style="flex:1;">
            <div class="panel-heading">
                I am bootstrap 3 panel title
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <img src="exmpl-img" class="img-responsive">
                <p>
                    Some Text Here
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

I say again,it works with bootstrap 3 panel component which needs to have same height.
